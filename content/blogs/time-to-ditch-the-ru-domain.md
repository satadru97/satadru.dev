Time to say good bye to satad.ru!

## Why a .ru domain?
The first question is why I was using a .ru domain to begin with? Why not a more recognizable tld like .com, .in or .net? Was I not aware of the bad reputation of .ru being heavily used for scams and spams?

The answer is YES! I knew it was a bad idea. I knew I will need to switch to some reputable TLDs sooner or later.

The only reason I had decided to go ahead with the satad.ru domain name was because it was really special to me.

**Just remove the "dot" and go figure it out! Yes it matches my first name character by character.**

So, in 2018 I registered satad.ru from [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.in/) and was renewing it every year since then. Yearly cost was around 700 INR.

It was about to expire in May and I was about to renew it this time as well.

## Why I'm switching now?

Imagine my surprise when I received the above mail, offering me to renew the domain for a steal deal of 82,599.00 INR!

It had to be a glitch right? So I immediately logged in to my Hostinger control panel and the final price was 97,466.82 INR!

I did check with Hostinger support regarding this and turns out they are not going to provide .ru domain services anymore due to Russia Ukraine conflict.

So, I was left with no choice other than moving to a new domain.

## Choosing a new domain

### What I was looking for

- It should be short. Preferably myfirstname(dot)extension.
- The extension should not have any bad reputation as that can result the website/email being blocked for some people.
- It should not be too pricey to maintain!

.com was obviously I first choice. But sadly myfirstname(dot)com was not available. 

### Why .dev?

- .dev is a newer TLD and particularly popular among developers. So it matches my job profile.
- satadru.dev was available!
- The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list includes the.dev TLD. This implies that all connections to.dev domains must use HTTPS; separate HSTS registration or configuration is not necessary. It is "encrypted by default" for the.dev domain.

## Domain registration

After finalizing the domain name I had to choose registrar who supports .dev. I went with [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) because of their no markup domain price and their awesome free services (which I was using previously as well).

The registration process was seamless and very straight forward.

That's it. Welcome to [satadru.dev](https://satadru.dev/)!
