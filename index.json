Why not a more recognizable tld like .com, .in or .net? Was I not aware of the bad reputation of .ru being heavily used for scams and spams?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer is YES! I knew it was a bad idea. I knew I will need to switch to some reputable TLDs sooner or later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only reason I had decided to go ahead with the satad.ru domain name was because it was really special to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust remove the \u0026ldquo;dot\u0026rdquo; and go figure it out! Yes it matches my first name character by character.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, in 2018 I registered satad.ru from \u003ca href=\"https://www.hostinger.in/\"\u003eHostinger\u003c/a\u003e and was renewing it every year since then. Yearly cost was around 700 INR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about to expire in May and I was about to renew it this time as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-im-switching-now\"\u003eWhy I\u0026rsquo;m switching now?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.satadru.dev/satadru.dev/images/blogs/1_Time_To_Ditch_The_.ru_Domain/expiry_reminder_satad.ru_hostinger.webp\" alt=\"expiry_reminder_satad.ru_hostinger\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine my surprise when I received the above mail, offering me to renew the domain for a steal deal of 82,599.00 INR!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be a glitch right? So I immediately logged in to my Hostinger control panel and the final price was 97,466.82 INR!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.satadru.dev/satadru.dev/images/blogs/1_Time_To_Ditch_The_.ru_Domain/renew_satad.ru_hostinger.webp\" alt=\"renew_satad.ru_hostinger\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did check with Hostinger support regarding this and turns out they are not going to provide .ru domain services anymore due to Russia Ukraine conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.satadru.dev/satadru.dev/images/blogs/1_Time_To_Ditch_The_.ru_Domain/renew_satad.ru_hostinger_support.webp\" alt=\"renew_satad.ru_hostinger_support\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I was left with no choice other than moving to a new domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"choosing-a-new-domain\"\u003eChoosing a new domain\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-i-was-looking-for\"\u003eWhat I was looking for\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt should be short. Preferably myfirstname(dot)extension.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe extension should not have any bad reputation as that can result the website/email being blocked for some people.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt should not be too pricey to maintain!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.com was obviously I first choice. But sadly myfirstname(dot)com was not available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-dev\"\u003eWhy .dev?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e.dev is a newer TLD and particularly popular among developers. So it matches my job profile.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esatadru.dev was available!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list includes the.dev TLD. This implies that all connections to.dev domains must use HTTPS; separate HSTS registration or configuration is not necessary. It is \u0026ldquo;encrypted by default\u0026rdquo; for the.dev domain.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"domain-registration\"\u003eDomain registration\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter finalizing the domain name I had to choose registrar who supports .dev. I went with \u003ca href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\"\u003eCloudflare\u003c/a\u003e because of their no markup domain price and their awesome free services (which I was using previously as well).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe registration process was seamless and very straight forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.satadru.dev/satadru.dev/images/blogs/1_Time_To_Ditch_The_.ru_Domain/registering_satadru.dev_cloudflare.webp\" alt=\"registering_satadru.dev_cloudflare\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.satadru.dev/satadru.dev/images/blogs/1_Time_To_Ditch_The_.ru_Domain/registered_satadru.dev_cloudflare.webp\" alt=\"registered_satadru.dev_cloudflare\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it.
